### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Japanese PhD student who wants to code something fun.  
I'm interested in playing video games, and my mains are music games and racing games. I also make games! Check out my 'floor-and-ceiling' music game, **[Twin Horizons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352730/Twin_Horizons/)** found on Steam.

(Most of my codebase I tinker with often (and by that I mean ones for Twin Horizons) are in GitLab, so I'm not too active on GitHub.)
