### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Japanese who wants to code something fun.  
I'm interested in playing video games, and my mains are music games and racing games. I also *make* games! Check out my 'floor-and-ceiling' music game, **[Twin Horizons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352730/Twin_Horizons/)** found on Steam.
